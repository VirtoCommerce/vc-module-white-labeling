# White Labeling
The White Labeling module enables organizations to enhance the enterprise user experience by customizing branding elements such as logos, favicons, colors, and footer links based on the logged-in organization context. This module ensures that users from different organizations see personalized branding elements after signing in, improving overall UX and brand consistency.

## Key Features
1. **Branding Configuration**: Display organization-specific logos, favicons, colors, and footer links post-login.
2. **White labeling**: Resolve branding based on the organization context after user authentication.
3. **Integration with Virto Frontend:** Seamlessly integrate customized branding elements into Virto Commerce Storefront.
4. **Custom Domain:** Assign a custom domain with the organization to allow branding activation on the first visit.
5. **Automated FavIcon Generation**: The module uses [Virto Commerce Image Tools module](https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-module-image-tools/) for fav icon generation.
